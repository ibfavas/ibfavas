👋 Hi, I’m Mohammad Favas S.

![tryhackme stats](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibfavas/ibfavas/master/assets/thm_propic.png)

🧠 I’m a cybersecurity enthusiast transitioning from software development to ethical hacking and defense strategies.

🔒 I’m currently pursuing the CICSA course for the EC-Council Certified Security Analyst (CSA) certification.

🎯 My long-term goal is to specialize in Red Team Operations and advanced penetration testing.

💻 Previously, I worked in Android and Web Development, which gave me a strong foundation in programming and system architecture — skills I now apply to cybersecurity.

🤝 I’m looking to collaborate on cybersecurity projects, threat simulations, and vulnerability research.

⚡ Fun fact: I love analyzing how systems can be both built and broken — and how ethical hackers can make them stronger.
